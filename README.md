# hello-world
jr first foray into exploring github
slightly confused but getting there
still confused cant seem to edit my
hello.py file
ok managed that but not sure how i did it
I want to start another project to contain
my Python User Guide but need to understand 
more how this whole thing works.
The only way to do this is to keep using it!

that worked by pressing the big commit button 
which appears when you are in edit mode.
I chose to commit directly to the main branch
but there was a chance to create a new branch 
for this commit. do it this time.
Did that - created a Patch file then 
did a Pull request then merged it back into main
then deleted the patch file

new entruy after 24 days
could not log onto github on pi400 cos 
sign in prompt not showing. bug in chrome 
browser. not showing horizontal scroll bar
